# Overview

By the title of the repository you can see that i have made a web scraper or really the start of a web scraper. I started this project to learn rust and loved the learning. 

This software goes onto a designated website and pulls information on the top 250 movies and sorts it so you can see the runtime, rating, and the year released. Then it sorts the data so you can try and find similarities. In the future I have started the development of exporting the data to a CSV file so the user can manipulate the data in other programs.
